# Cerebro

Cerebro is a delightful toolkit for building Node-based command-line interfaces (CLIs) in TypeScript or modern JavaScript, with support for:

*parameters* - command-line arguments and options

*system* - executing other command-line scripts

*prompt* - auto-complete prompts

*print* - printing colors and tables

> Note: in addition, `cerebro` supports expanding your CLI’s ecosystem with a robust set of plugins and extensions.

[*http* - interacting with API servers](./packages/cerebro-http-extension)

[*notify* - send cross-platform native notifications](./packages/cerebro-notify-extension)

[*packageManager* - installing NPM packages with Yarn or NPM](./packages/cerebro-package-manager-extension)

You want to use cerebro if:

* You need to build a CLI app
* You want to have powerful tools at your fingertips

## Supported Node.js Versions

Libraries in this ecosystem make a best effort to track
[Node.js release schedule](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/). Here’s [a
post on why we think this is important](https://medium.com/the-node-js-collection/maintainers-should-consider-following-node-js-release-schedule-ab08ed4de71a).
